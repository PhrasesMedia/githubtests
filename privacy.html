    <h1>BabyPay Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 23 November 2025</p>
  </header>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how BabyPay (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and stores
    information when you use the BabyPay estimator hosted at
    <strong>https://phrasesmedia.github.io/BabyPayApp/</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>
    BabyPay is a simple calculator. The income figures and leave details you type into the
    estimator are processed only in your browser and are <strong>not</strong> sent to our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pages viewed and basic interaction with the site</li>
    <li>Approximate location (city/region), device type, and browser type</li>
    <li>Referring sources (for example, if you clicked from another website)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is collected in aggregate and does not personally identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Cookies and tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Google Analytics may use cookies or similar technologies to help us understand how people
    use BabyPay so we can improve it. You can control or delete cookies in your browser settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Affiliate links</h2>
  <p>
    BabyPay may include affiliate links to third-party websites (for example, Amazon).
    If you click these links, those websites may collect data in accordance with their own
    privacy policies. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of
    those third-party sites.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store the values you enter into the calculator. Analytics data is retained by
    Google in line with their standard retention settings, which we use to understand
    overall usage trends only.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    BabyPay is intended for adults planning parental leave. It is not directed at children, and we
    do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of BabyPay after any changes
    means you accept the updated policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:
